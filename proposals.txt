GCP Proposal - 

Research Problem:
The project aims to address the critical challenge of defining a cross-cloud control plane for optimized preemptible instance allocation. Focused on leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools such as preemptible and spot instances, VM instances, and Kubernetes, our goal is to develop an advanced algorithm that enhances the dynamic allocation of cloud computing resources, drawing insights from historical data.

Key Milestones and Outcomes:
Algorithm Development: Formulate an innovative algorithm that leverages preemptible instances, spot instances, VM instances, and Kubernetes for optimized cross-cloud resource allocation.
Research Advancement: Contribute to the field by advancing research in dynamic allocation through the proposed algorithm, offering a robust solution for preemptible instance allocation based on historical data analysis.
Increased Productivity: Achieve a tangible increase in productivity by streamlining cloud computing resource allocation, resulting in cost-effectiveness and improved overall system efficiency.
Utilizing GCP Tools:
Harnessing the capabilities of GCP, the project envisions a transformation in algorithmic design for optimal instance allocation. By exploring preemptible instances, spot instances, VM instances, and Kubernetes, we aim to redefine resource allocation paradigms and unlock new levels of efficiency.

Enhancing GCP's Role:
Through collaboration with GCP, we aspire to reinvent algorithms, leveraging the platform's features to their fullest potential. GCP's support will be instrumental in fine-tuning instance allocation strategies, thereby maximizing the productivity and cost-effectiveness of cloud computing resources.
In the final phase, we anticipate integrating machine learning elements into the algorithm for real-time adaptation and further enhancing the precision of preemptible instance allocation.
